# E-Bookopolis

This is my term project for Level-2/Term-II under the course CSE 216: Database Sessional.\
The frontend is made using EJS, HTML, CSS, JS.\
The backend is made using NodeJS, ExpressJS, OracleDB.\
Here we used Oracle to store all our data in a database and used ExpressJS to make queries in the database.\
There are two types of user:
  1. Nomral User: They can create new account, login into that account, modify account information, search for books,mark favourite books, add books to cart, buy books and get reciept for the transaction
  2. Admin : They can add new books along with their relevent information, remove old books\


All transactions of a user is stored in transaction hisorty.\
There is also a blog where any user can post there writings. Other users can see and comment on that blog.
